## Notes

- **Pipeline status:** ✅ ALL 9 GOALS SHIPPED — main at 6dbcee0. 305 tests passing. Project complete.
- **PR #12 (Goal 7):** MERGED (752e8c1) — privacy/terms/contact/about pages, footer, cookie consent, AdSense loader, ad slots, robots.txt.
- **PR #13 (Goal 8):** ✅ MERGED (b39dfde on 2026-07-30) — 270 tests. Confidence tiers, subcategory profiles, 104 seeded products, material-parser aliases, cron routes, /admin/coverage page.

- **Dev Run #39 (2026-07-31):** PR #14 confirmed merged to main (ea4e0ba). Synced local main. 305 tests passing.
- **Dev Run #40 (2026-07-31):** All 9 TRDs marked `done` to reflect merged state (6dbcee0).
- **Dev Run #41 (2026-07-31):** No new TRDs. Found stale incomplete merge (origin/task/goal1-scaffold batch-lookup commits never landed in main). Fixed failing CommodityService test (wrong env mock path), committed and pushed (81f0fd4). 329 tests passing.
- **Dev Run #42 (2026-07-31):** No new TRDs. Committed pending backlog.md + two missing PRDs (goal1, goal2) that were untracked. Project remains complete.
- **Remaining Zach actions:** Q7-1 (AdSense publisher ID), Q7-3 (Privacy Policy data scope), Q-INFRA-2 (Discord allowlist — run `/discord:access`).
- **Dev Run #81 (2026-07-31):** No new TRDs for Goal 10 pipeline (still blocked on Zach's /merge). Identified Goal 11 PRD with a self-contained Save as Image sub-feature (no Goal 10 dependency). Wrote TRD goal11a-save-as-image.md, implemented SaveAsImageButton (dom-to-image-more, lazy-loaded, MIT license), wired into ProductPageClient. 7 new tests. 336 tests pass, tsc clean. Opened draft PR #19.
